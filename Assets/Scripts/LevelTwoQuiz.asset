  questions:
  - question: When crossing a light shelled female (X^l/X^l) with a dark shelled
      male (X^L/Y), what will be the shell colour of all male offspring?
    answers:
    - All light
    - All dark
    - 50% dark, 50% light
    - 75% dark, 25% light
    correctAnswerIndex: 0
  - question: In sex-linked inheritance for shell colour, why do males tend to express
      the recessive trait more frequently than females?
    answers:
    - Males have two X chromosomes
    - Males only have one X chromosome, so a recessive allele on that X will always
      be expressed
    - The Y chromosome suppresses dominant traits
    - Sex-linked traits are always expressed differently in male

  - question: To produce 100% light shelled offspring, which parental cross would
      work?
    answers:
    - "Light shelled female (X^b/X^b) \xD7 Dark shelled male (X^B/Y)"
    - "Light shelled female (X^b/X^b) \xD7 Light shelled male (X^b/Y)"
    - "Dark shelled female (X^B/X^b) \xD7 Light shelled male (X^b/Y)"
    - "Dark shelled female (X^B/X^B) \xD7 Dark shelled male (X^B/Y)"
